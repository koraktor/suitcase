Suitcase
========

This is the open source code of the iOS app [**Suitcase**][appstore]
([@suitcaseapp][twitter]). It contains the full code of formerly released app
versions (up until 2.3.0).

## Notice

The code is provided as-is and may require additional changes to be able to
build on current versions of Xcode and the iOS SDK.

## Contributions

As this code is more or less outdated, I wonâ€™t accept pull requests or issue
reports targeting the 1.x/2.x versions of the app.

Please report any bugs or feature request of the current version in the
[issue tracker of this project][issues].
